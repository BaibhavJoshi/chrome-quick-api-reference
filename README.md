# chrome-quick-api-reference
<br>

A simple chrome extension that grants users the ability to quickly navigate to the Chrome API reference pages using the omnibox. It also includes a "tip of the day" button, that, when clicked, shows the user a random, yet very relevant tip that gets updated every day.

This extension is an introductory project that serves to explore the concepts of service workers, state management, event handling, and content scripts.
